# TDDinSwift
Test-driven development tutorial given by Paul Solt. The project was to design a small project that lets 
users demo an app before upgrading. 

The test codes are written following laws of TDD
1. Failing Test (write the test first before the actual code, and then write a code that passes the test)
2. Enough to fail/fail to compile 
3. Only enough production code to pass

The test cases are designed in a way to test "time" -> if the user is using the app within a given valid
trial period (7 days) is valid or not.

TDD project that was done following video tutorial by Paul Solt.
